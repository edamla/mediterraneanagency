Welcome in our family where every day stories and characters comes to life!

Specialists in fiction and non-fiction for children, we make books for the international market.

Our books are well-known for the very high quality of their illustrations, translated in more than 20 languages and sold all over the world.

We are authors and illustrators of our books, they are home-made, made in Italy, and made with love.

“Our parents started working as freelance illustrators over 30 years ago and from their experience 15 years ago the Ant’s Books Packager was born. Every day we all work together to develop new ideas to offer you the best products.”
— Eleonora Barsotti – Art Director

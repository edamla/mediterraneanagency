Founded in 2022, Bulutsu Yayınları entered the literary world with children’s books that stand out for their creativity and literary quality.

The publishing house’s mission is to offer children not only captivating stories but also works that are both aesthetically rich and intellectually stimulating. With a diverse selection of fiction, non-fiction, board books, and poetry, it aims to spark imagination and deepen children’s understanding of the world.

Through a fresh and innovative approach, Bulutsu Yayınları ensures that each book is a carefully crafted work of art, blending language, design, and storytelling.

The publisher strives to cultivate a love for art and literature with high-quality books that enhance children’s reading experiences. It believes that children’s literature has the power to inspire readers of all ages.

Bulutsu is the Turkish word for “nebula,” referring to vast clouds of dust and gas in the infinite expanse of space. These colorful nebulas, with their gases and dust, release immense energy that forms stars. For billions of years, they have adorned our skies, serving as the most beautiful entertainment on clear summer nights, the compass for travelers of ancient times, the passionate curiosity of astronomers, and the miraculous stars that children eagerly await to wish upon.
As these magnificent nebulas create stars in the endless sky, on Earth, the Bulutsu Publishing team creates books. With great excitement, we unleash all our knowledge and energy, working to tell stories that guide children’s lives, brighten their days, tickle their curiosity, and awaken their sense of wonder.
Just as the stars in the sky have been our compass throughout history, books are the most beautiful compass for finding our own path.

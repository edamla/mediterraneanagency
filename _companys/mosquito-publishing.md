Dear Children and Grown-Ups Who Were Once Children,

Every child should have fairy tales.
Every child should have doors that open to colorful worlds of imagination.
Every child should have “once upon a time” stories they long to see come true.
Every child should have horizons they reach by going over hills and valleys, short or long.
Every child should have role models they can say, “I want to be like them.”
Every child should have freedoms…

In today’s world, where even books have turned into screens and stories begin and end in just a few lines, we still believe in the power and magic of words.
We know that no picture we publish can be more beautiful than the one a child paints in their imagination.
We are aware that children’s books should speak not only to the eye, but also to the ear and the heart.
That is why we hand the brush to them.
That is why we embark on this journey with the dream of a library that grows and evolves with them.

We set out with the mission of instilling good virtues in the generation that will shape the future.
With stories that will nurture our children’s abilities to listen, to imagine, to empathize, and to identify, we greet all our readers with a warm “Hello.”

We are here to draw a path from pen to heart, to bring beauty to our present and our future.

With Mosquito, for those who understand…

Nokta Publishing Group is an entity established under the umbrella of İLKE Foundation, encompassing several imprints including Nokta Kitap, Fikir Kitap, Mesken Kitap, and İktisat Yayınları. In addition, the journals İnsan&Toplum, Tujise, İş Ahlakı, and the Stüdyo platform also operate within the group.
Since 2016, our publishing brands have published over 200 books. We have now brought these brands together under a renewed structure, aiming to publish in diverse fields such as academia, thought, Islamic economics, children's literature, and religious education.
________________________________________
The world is rapidly changing and transforming at an accelerating pace in recent years. Societies, cultures, and geographies are both agents and stages of this transformation.
The way we respond to current developments will significantly shape the new realities, emerging issues, and encounters of tomorrow. Muslim societies are not exempt from this reality.
We can only succeed in correctly interpreting, understanding, and generating ideas about these processes through a scholarly perspective—one that is confident, composed, realistic, data-driven, and holistic.
Nokta Publishing Group aims to build a dynamic bridge between the past, present, and future of societies with precisely this approach. It seeks to engage with contemporary issues and their impact on communities, while also aspiring to introduce new agendas concerning modern challenges.
Now is a point for new beginnings.

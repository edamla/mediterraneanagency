In 1938, Ahmed Ibrahim (my father) established Nahdet Misr for Publishing with the aim
of spreading knowledge and culture in Egypt and the Arab world. Around more than eight decades have passed during which we have published thousands of books that we thoughtfully chose to raise the general awareness and develop the creative and intellectual abilities of the Arab readers. We have published literary and non-literary books for the most iconic authors, and public figures in our Arab world. We were also keen to publish books for promising potential writers, and have made sure that all of our books are available at affordable prices. Furthermore, we have published a variety of children’s books and publications, and produced the Arabic versions of best global edutainment publications with the aim of encouraging children to love reading at an early age. Throughout the years, we have succeeded in attaining 40 international and national awards, most of which were for children’s literature.
Spreading knowledge along with maintaining our identity, mission and values has been our goal over the decades. Much has been achieved, yet we couldn’t rest on our laurels, as the development of all areas related to publishing continued to be the basis of our work. Nahdet Misr took concrete steps towards developing its print house to be one of the largest and most developed in the MENA region, with a production capacity of 500,000 books a day, which affords us the opportunity to distribute our products across more than 12,000 selling outlets worldwide. In line with the latest technological changes, we have focused on presenting our literary and educational products in digital formats to keep up with the worldwide technological advancement.
The sense of belonging to Nahdet Misr has always overwhelmed me with an unrivaled feeling of contentment, and has concurrently instilled a great sense of responsibility, leading to a pledge to persevere to enhance the lives of millions of people around the world, through meaningful content and innovative tools that enlighten their brains and hearts.

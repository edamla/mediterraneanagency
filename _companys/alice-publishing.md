Since the beginning of the Alice Éditions adventure in 1995, we have chosen to be a children’s and young adult publishing house with a social commitment.
Our deep belief is that a beautiful book is a wonderful tool to open the minds of children and teenagers to the values we hold dear: respect (for oneself, for others, and for the environment), open-mindedness, solidarity, and dialogue.
We want to spark both thought and emotion. To awaken critical thinking through the pleasure of reading. To convey meaningful messages and inspire the love of books.
Our small but passionate team carefully selects books for the ideas they convey – books that reflect an inclusive society, books that address important social issues – and for their ability to move readers through compelling stories or beautiful illustrations.
Our Values
The values our team upholds, both in daily life and at work:
•	Respect for oneself, others, and the environment
•	Openness to the world and to others
•	Solidarity
•	Dialogue
•	Awareness of diversity

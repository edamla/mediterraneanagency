İz Publishing, one of the most significant milestones in intellectual publishing in Turkey, was established in 1990. From the very beginning, our publishing house attracted the attention of readers through its meticulous book selection and careful editorial work. Focusing initially on the largely neglected concept of “tradition,” İz Publishing began to reconnect Turkish readers with a cultural past that had been suppressed during the single-party era and through military coups.

While fulfilling this foundational mission to a great extent, İz Publishing also turned its focus to contemporary literature, aiming to complement the restored traditional gaps—thus earning a well-deserved reputation in a short period. The collected works of several prominent intellectual figures in Turkey, critical research and analysis works that contribute to our cultural accumulation, landmark literary masters, and notable translations from foreign literature have all reached readers through İz.

The publishing house’s extensive portfolio has also been enriched by various periodicals over the years. Among them:
	•	İzlenim, a monthly and weekly magazine published in the 1990s;
	•	Bilgi ve Hikmet (“Knowledge and Wisdom”), which—despite only having 12 issues—left a lasting impact;
	•	İktisat ve İş Dünyası (“Economics and Business World”), published between 1991–1993;
	•	Kitap Postası (“The Book Post”), active from 2005–2007;
	•	And more recently, Post Öykü, one of the leading contemporary short story magazines since 2015, followed by Muhayyel, have all contributed to İz’s lasting legacy in Turkish cultural history.

One of the key milestones in İz Publishing’s history was its foundational role in the launch of Yeni Şafak newspaper. Established in 1995 with a broad intellectual perspective, distanced from the daily skirmishes and anxieties of politics, Yeni Şafak operated under the roof of İz Publishing until March 1998.

Prominent Turkish intellectuals and writers such as Rasim Özdenören, Hayreddin Karaman, Akif İnan, Erdem Bayazıt, Alaeddin Özdenören, Ersin Nazif Gürdoğan, İlhan Kutluer, Turan Oflazoğlu, Akif Hayta, Hasan Aycın, Cihan Aktaş, Cemal Şakar, Metin Karabaşoğlu, Ömer Faruk Dönmez, Recep Alpyağıl, Ali Köse, Ali Haydar Haksal, Sadık Albayrak, Mustafa Ruhi Şirin, and Sedat Umran have had either all or significant portions of their works published by İz.

Having set out with the aim of leaving a mark in pursuit of the “sacred trace,” İz Publishing has remained committed since its founding to making a lasting contribution and impact in the realms of knowledge, thought, culture, and art in Turkey. With over 900 titles published, the house continues to operate with the same seriousness and integrity as on its first day. Staying true to its principle of prioritizing quality above all, İz Publishing continues on its journey with the ambition of achieving even greater success in the future.

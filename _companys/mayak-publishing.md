Although Mayak Publishing House has started a new activity,
it has achieved many successes. These successes include
collaborating with 15 authors, publishing about 30 books, and
becoming a member of the "Azerbaijan Publishers Association"
Public Union.
In all the exhibitions we participated in during 1 year, we
witnessed that our books were highly appreciated by the readers.
It should be noted that the TV series “Season of the Scorpion”
was based on the motifs of the detective novel “The Scorpion”
by Jeyhun Hidayatli.

DC Canada Education Publishing is a small innovative publisher of children’s books, games, and music in Ottawa, Canada. Our diverse and passionate team consists of writers, editors, illustrators, and creative directors who are dedicated to creating stimulating educational materials for children around the world.
DC Canada started publishing ESL textbooks for China back in the 1990s. Through a series of collaborations with Duval House Publishing, the University of Alberta, and Hebei Education Publishing House, a collection of grade 1 – 12, Ministry of Education approved English learning textbooks were launched.
After the early success in China, DC Canada expanded its mandate to include science, literature, and mathematics in addition to ESL. Our award-winning educational resources are designed for both school and at-home use.
Since then, we’ve sold millions of books around the world!
We acknowledge the financial support of the Government of Canada for our publishing activities and the Ontario Media Development Corporation Book Fund.

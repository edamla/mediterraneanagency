Hey Take it easy I’m here.
I’ve told you that running around is my thing and this one is my
new adventure. Firstly, when I started secondary school, I thought
I should choose a good school. But What happened?! The system
has automatically enrolled me somewhere. I asked myself How
much a school can be different from another and accepted because
there was nothing else to do. But I’ve had the learnt my question’s
answer by living in it. The school was not an ordinary school but
almost interesting events arena! How Doner kebab on the rice and
the treasures of Byzantium can meet in a book! Why does a person
want to be “zero” in life! And why did I hurt myself to witness some-
thing! I wait for those who look to be a part of my story. Have a nice
day to you all!

This year, Mediterranean Agency had the pleasure of participating in the Baku Book Fair 2024, a key literary event in the heart of the Caucasus. Bringing together publishers, authors, and literary professionals from around the world, the fair was an incredible opportunity to explore new markets, exchange ideas, and strengthen international collaborations.
As a literary agency dedicated to connecting stories with global audiences, we were thrilled to engage with publishers from Azerbaijan and beyond, discovering exciting new titles and discussing opportunities for translation and rights sales. Events like these remind us of the universal power of literature and its ability to bring cultures closer together.
We look forward to continuing our work in the region and returning next year for more inspiring conversations!
Letâ€™s bring stories to the world, together!

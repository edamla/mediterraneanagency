Mediterranean Agency at Bologna Children's Book Fair 2025 ✨ 

We are truly enjoying our time at this year’s Bologna Children’s Book Fair — a wonderful occasion to meet publishing professionals from around the world, discover exciting new titles, and engage in inspiring conversations.

We also hope that our participating partners Alia publishing house, AZ Editora, GAGA PUBLISHING and Bulutsu Publishing are having a productive and successful fair. It’s always a pleasure to see their work appreciated on such an international stage.

Looking forward to meeting again at the next fair!

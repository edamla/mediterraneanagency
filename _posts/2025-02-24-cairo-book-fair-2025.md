As a literary agency, we attended the Cairo Book Fair 2025 to connect with international publishers and promote our authors globally. We participated in panels and networking events, securing new copyright agreements, especially in the Middle East and Africa. Being part of this cultural and literary exchange was a valuable experience for our agency.

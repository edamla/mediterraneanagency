MIn 2024, our team had the privilege of participating in the Astana Publishing Fellowship, an exclusive program designed to foster international collaboration in the publishing industry. Through insightful discussions, networking sessions, and market presentations, we explored exciting opportunities for rights sales and cultural exchange in Central Asia and beyond.
The program provided a valuable platform to connect with Kazakhstani and international publishers, discover emerging literary voices, and strengthen industry partnerships. Events like these reaffirm the importance of global cooperation in bringing diverse stories to new audiences.
We look forward to continuing our collaborations and expanding our presence in this dynamic region!

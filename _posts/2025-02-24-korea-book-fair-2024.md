In 2024, our team had the privilege of participating in the Korea Fellowship Program, an exclusive event designed to foster international publishing collaborations. Through insightful meetings and networking sessions, we explored opportunities to bring Korean literature to new audiences and strengthen cross-cultural exchanges.
Following the fellowship program, we attended the Seoul International Book Fair, where we engaged with industry professionals, discovered exciting new titles, and expanded our global network. It was an inspiring experience, and we look forward to future collaborations in the Korean publishing market!

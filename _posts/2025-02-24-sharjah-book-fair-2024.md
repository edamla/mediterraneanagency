In 2024, our team had the pleasure of attending the Publisher Conference ahead of the Sharjah Book Fair, where we engaged in insightful discussions on the future of international publishing and literary rights. Following the conference, we participated in the book fair itself -one of the world's most prestigious literary events- where we explored new publishing opportunities, strengthened industry connections, and connected with partners from around the globe.
Looking forward to next year!
